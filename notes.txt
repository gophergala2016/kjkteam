## Notes on git integration.

If there is `git-foo` binary in $PATH, doing `git foo`
will make `git` invoke `git-foo` binary.

This is how webdiff implements `git webdiff` (has `git-webdiff`
wrapper scripts that invokes `webdiff` proper).

Not sure what the exact protocol between git and the executable is.
